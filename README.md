The mha file extension is related to MetaImage format, a special medicine image format used in the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit and probably other graphic visualization software used in medicine.

This code reads MRI brain scans (.mha file) on matlab with a very clear GUI that can show all the 3D scans in very good way. this is needed in many projects that deal with MRI scans and needs to read it well.

The code is implemented in a GUI (user friendly) to facilitate using the program with a 3D model for the brain for best visibility.
